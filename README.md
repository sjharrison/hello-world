# hello-world
Hello.  I'm Steve.
I love finding out about the world by reading and exploring technologies and science.
So, I don't have enough time to specialise in anything..... therefore I know a bit about everything.
I do know a lot about how IT projects and people should work together..... therefore my day job is either Tech Leader, or Software Architect.
Right now I'm looking into Docker, Hadoop, and Bootstrap.
